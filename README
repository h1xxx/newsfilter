newsfilter
==========

A small program to fetch articles from Hacker News, lobste.rs and badcyber.com
and extract only tech articles with use of blacklisted domains and keywords.

Prepares an html file with a list of articles that can be read from any www
browser.

First program run grabs all the available and relevant articles, subsequent
runs show only new articles that came up since the last run.

Goals:
- focus on technical side of computing
- find high quality, but less popular articles
- save time and energy while browsing hacker news
- lessen the addictive quality of HN by showing each article only once

Topics permanently blocked by default:
- news from the outside world
- business side of things
- career, interviewing, money, stock market etc.
- so called modern web (large browsers, JavaScript, Node.js etc.)
- non-free platforms (Windows, Apple)
- Emacs (I really tried to like it, lol)
- GUI, anything about computer graphics
- audio processing
- smartphones

Topics filtered temporarily:
- Rust - until the language becomes more settled.

Only Hacker News stories are filtered, as other sources moderate their content
heavily.

===

depending on where you have your binary file
  $ newsfilter || ./newsfilter

notes
=====

- input and output data is stored in ~/.local/share/newsfilter/

- first run is quite long as all current hacker news stories are fetched

- next run contains only new stories, i.e. stories that were not included in
  the previous html file

- blocked.domains is a list of domains that usually provide non-technical
  articles on hacker news; every article from this domain on HN is filtered out

- blocked.keywords are searched for in hacker news story titles, but not in
  lobste.rs and badcyber.com article titles

- filtering rules are stored in filterHn and filterLrs functions in
  newsfilter.go

- dump-hn.go is a tool to dump all comments and stories on HN into
  /tmp/hndump.tsv, size of the files is ca. 15GB

- ./scripts/ directory contains a bunch of scripts that help me to decide if a
  keyword will be useful and not overly strict in filtering stories



todo (or not)
=============

- add new stories and filter them
- on http error skip processing
- add option to show blocked pages sorted by popularity and with a reason for a
block (what url + what keyword)
- calculate avg 'commenters/new stories' or 'comments/new stories' ratio per hour
- when searching for hn news skip http and https
- when searching for hn news return list of all submissions and print all of them
- when searching for hn news analyze if url parameters should be dropped as well
- find users submitting shit and block them
