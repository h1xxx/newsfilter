newsfilter
==========

A small program to fetch articles from Hacker News, lobste.rs and badcyber.com
and then extract only technical ones with use of blacklisted domains and keywords.

Prepares an html file with a list of articles that can be read from any www
browser.

Goals:
- find high quality, but less popular articles
- save time and energy while browsing hacker news
- lessen addictive quality of Hacker News, by showing only each article once

Topics permanently blocked by default:
- news from the outside world
- business side of things
- career, interviewing, money etc.
- so called modern web (large browsers, JavaScript, Node.js etc.)
- non-free platforms (Windows, Apple)
- Emacs (I really tried to like it, lol)
- GUI, graphics
- audio processing
- smartphones.

Topics filtered temporarily:
- Rust - until the language becomes more settled.

Only Hacker News stories are filtered, as other sources modarate their content
heavily.

notes
=====

- input and output data is stored in ~/.config/newsfilter

- first run is quite long as all current hacker news stories are fetched

- next run contains only new stories, i.e. stories that were not included in
  the previous html file

- blocked.domains is a list of domains that usually provide non-technical
  articles on hacker news

- blocked.keywords are searched for in hacker news story titles, but not in
  lobste.rs titles; lobste.rs has in general higher quality of articles, so no
  filtering is done there, except for score and number of comments
 
- filtering rules are stored in filterHn and filterLrs functions
