newsfilter

A small program to fetch articles from Hacker News and lobste.rs and extract
only technical ones with use of blacklisted domains and keywords.

Prepares an html file with a list of articles that can be read from any www
browser.


notes

- input and output data is stored in ~/.config/newsfilter

- first run is quite long as all current hacker news stories are fetched

- next run contains only new stories, i.e. stories that were not included in
  the previous html file

- blocked.domains is a list of domains that usually provide non-technical
  articles on hacker news

- blocked.keywords are searched for in hacker news story titles, but not in
  lobste.rs titles; lobste.rs has in general higher quality of articles, so no
  filtering is done there, except for score and number of comments
 
- filtering rules are stored in filterHn and filterLrs functions
